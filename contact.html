                    Eventually I would like to get more content here, some about my history and my personal hobbies.
                    For now it will contain an informal introduction.  Before this degree, I had got to University of 
                    Alaska for physics and had hoped to find an opportunity in physics education.  As things would have it,
                    plans ended up changing and I navigated the job market as a physicist with a bachelor's degree.  This seemed
                    to highlight the fact that no one knows exactly what a physicist does, even physicists themselves. This gave time
                    to think about what skills would help utilitize my existing skills and have a clear, desirable skill.  This was 
                    when I discovered the Post-bachelor program at OSU.  Really enjoying it so far, although doing the fast-track is 
                    a bit like wrestling a tornado.      
                    </p>

                    I love to play music and had an amazing opportunity to be part of the fairbanks music scene.  It was then I came to 
                    discover my love for the bass guitar and haven't put it down since.  In my free time, I continuously find new projects,
                    from tinkering with electronics (hoping to build a 3-d printer and post on here), making soundtracks for friends movies
                    and podcasts, and continously trying to master programing in a way that I can share it with others in a practical sense.
