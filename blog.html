                <p>
                    This was an earlier project I completed a few years back, when I was first
                    learning how to code. This was a labor of love for months to help my friend
                    who was wanting to launch a website for their natural green cleaning business.

                <p>
                    This was a class project designing our own Xiangqi Game.  In the future, this section would include
                    some detail about exactly how the project was designed and then would include an read more
                    hyperlink that takes the user to the project page, where they would find the full code (unlike seen to the left).
                    This was just a snippet of the code, in the scroll box, that I would like to in the future have the content load
                    the script from a file and not hard coded into the html file.
